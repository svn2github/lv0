        ...return to level zero

They call us names:
elite, micro, minimal, nano, old school, pico, retro, rock solid, secure, 
simple, stable, straight edge or suckless OS

Several of them we like as they match our philosophy.

Some of our features and goals: 
- no ELF but instead flat binaries
- no wide characters and only ASCII
- no layers and no bloated abstractions 
- no multi-language support only one simple constructed language: toki pona
- no paging, only dead simple memory management
- no scheduler, one process per core
- no threads, just processes
- own minimal boot loader
- self-hosting using own compiler with support for a subset of ANSI C
- support for serial console
- support only recent hardware (x86-64)
