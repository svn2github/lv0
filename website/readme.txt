   They call us names: micro, minimal, nano, old school, pico, retro,
   rock solid, secure, simple, stable, straight edge or suckless OS.
   Several of them we like as they match our philosophy.

   Some of our features and goals:

      - lightweight with approximately 5000 source lines of code (SLOC)
      - no abstractions or bloated layers
      - no a.out, COFF or ELF but instead flat binaries
      - no multi-language support only english or maybe toki pona
      - no paging, only dead simple memory management
      - no scheduler, one process per core
      - no threads, just processes
      - no wide characters and only ASCII
      - own minimal boot loader
      - self-hosting using own compiler
      - support for serial console
      - support only recent hardware (x86-64 and arm)
      - support high resolution vesa graphic modes
